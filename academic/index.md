## Academic: Linguist &amp; Philosopher
					
I'm currently pursuing an M.A. in linguistics, at Michigan State University, where I also just finished a B.A. in linguistics and a B.A. in philosophy.

As an undergraduate, I was President (er&#8230;, well, 'Prime Minister', technically) of [qUALMS][qUALMS], the "q Undergraduate Association for Linguistics at Michigan State", founded by [Chris Heffner][Chris].

If you really want to&#8212;though I'm not sure why you would want to&#8212;you can do the following here:

- [Figure out what I'm (currently) interested in researching][interests]
- [Take a look at current and former work&#8212;that is, work over which my embarrassment is not great enough to prevent me from putting it online][work]
- [Take a look at my CV][CV]
- [Go figure out what this 'qUALMS' business is about][qUALMS]
	
## Modi operandi:

- [Coffee][coffee]
- [LaTeX][LaTeX]
- [Structured Procrastination][procrastinate] (brought to my attention by [Marcin Morzycki][Marcin])
