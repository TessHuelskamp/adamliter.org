## Academic: Linguist &amp; Philosopher
					
I'm currently working toward a B.A. in philosophy, a B.A. in linguistics, and an M.A. in linguistics, all at Michigan State University. God knows what I'll do after that.

I'm also President (er&#8230;, well, 'Prime Minister', technically) of [qUALMS](http://www.msu.edu/~qualms), the "q Undergraduate Association for Linguistics at Michigan State", founded by [Chris Heffner](http://ling.umd.edu/~heffner).

If you really want to&#8212;though I'm not sure why you would want to&#8212;you can do the following here:

- [Figure out what I'm (currently) interested in researching](http://adamliter.org/academic/interests)
- [Take a look at current and former work&#8212;that is, work over which my embarrassment is not great enough to prevent me from putting it online](http://adamliter.org/academic/work)
- [Take a look at my CV](http://adamliter.org/content/adamlitercv.pdf)
- [Go figure out what this 'qUALMS' business is about](http://www.msu.edu/~qualms)
	
## Modi operandi:

- [Coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee)
- [LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX)
- [Structured Procrastination](http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/) (brought to my attention by [Marcin Morzycki](https://www.msu.edu/~morzycki))
