## Academic
					
I'm currently pursuing an M.A. in linguistics, at Michigan State University, where I also just finished a B.A. in linguistics and a B.A. in philosophy. Additionally, I work in the [MSU Language Acquisition Lab][lab] as a Research Assistant for [Alan Munn][Alan] and [Cristina Schmitt][Cristina].

As an undergraduate, I was President (er&#8230;, well, 'Prime Minister', technically) of [qUALMS][qUALMS], the "q Undergraduate Association for Linguistics at Michigan State", founded by [Chris Heffner][Chris].

If you really want to---though I'm not sure why you would want to---you can do the following here:

- [Figure out what a 'linguist' is and what I'm (currently) interested in researching][interests]
- [Take a look at my current and former work][work]
- [Take a look at my CV][CV]
- [Go figure out what this 'qUALMS' business is about][qUALMS]
	
## Modi operandi:

- [Coffee][coffee]
- [LaTeX][LaTeX]
- [Structured Procrastination][procrastinate] (brought to my attention by [Marcin Morzycki][Marcin])
