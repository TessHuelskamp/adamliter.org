## Research Interests

Of course, as an undergraduate (human?), my interests are constantly growing and shifting. Consider the following a snapshot of my research interests at the time of updating this page.					

### Linguistics:

The cut and dry version: my interests are semantics, syntax, their interface, and (first) language acquisition.

### Philosophy:

With regard to philosophy, my interests are mostly in epistemology, feminist philosophy&#8212;especially feminist epistemology&#8212;, philosophy of language, environmental philosophy, (maybe) metaethics, the philosophical aspects of activism&#8212;if there can be said to be any, which I think there can&#8212;, and vice versa&#8212;*viz.*, in the activist aspects of philosophy.
