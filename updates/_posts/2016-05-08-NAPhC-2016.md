<p>
{% assign collab = site.data.collaborators["karthik_durvasula"] %}{% include print_only-last_collab.html %} and I gave an invited talk, "Complexity of feature generalizations and learnability", at the <a href="http://linguistics.concordia.ca/naphc9/">9th North American Phonology Conference</a>, hosted by Concordia University, in Montréal, Canada. (The title of the talk in the program ("Learning Phonological Patterns from Ambiguous Data") is different from the title that we put on our slides ("Complexity of feature generalizations and learnability"). Oops. <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code>)
