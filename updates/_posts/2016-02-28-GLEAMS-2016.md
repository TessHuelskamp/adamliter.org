{% assign collab = site.data.collaborators["tess_huelskamp"] %}{% include print_collabs.html %} 
{% assign collab = site.data.collaborators["susima_weerakoon"] %}{% include print_collabs.html %} 
and {% assign collab = site.data.collaborators["alan_munn"] %}{% include print_only-last_collab.html %}.
