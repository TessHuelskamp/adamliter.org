I gave the second part of an impromptu two-part workshop introducing linguists to the typesetting software LaTeX at the <a href="https://lsa2015.uchicago.edu/">2015 Linguistic Institute</a>. The handout for the workshop can be found <a href="https://bit.ly/latex-workshop">here</a>. As much as I can, I will keep the handout up to date so that it continues to be useful. Minimally, I plan to add information about bibliographies soon.
