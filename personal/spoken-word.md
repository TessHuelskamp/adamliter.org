## Spoken Word That I Procrastinate To

This is a list of spoken word pieces that I (i) procrastinate to, (ii) would (or have) watche(d) one, two, three, and even twenty-seven times, (iii) don't want to ever forget about, (iv) and/or might want to share with friends (and hence want to have some documentation of the name of the piece and/or a link to the piece).

The list is currently organized by the artist (specifically, by last name, unless the artist uses a stage name, like Guante).[^1]
