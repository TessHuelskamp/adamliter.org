## Spoken Word That I Procrastinate To

This is a list of spoken word pieces that I (i) procrastinate to, (ii) really like, (iii) don't want to ever forget about, (iv) and/or might want to share with friends (and hence want to have some documentation of the name of the piece and/or a link to the piece).

The list is currently organized by the artist (specifically, by last name, unless the artist uses a stage name, like Guante).[^1]

### H

- Neil Hilborn — [Mating Habits of the North American Hipster][MatingHipster]

### M

- Lily Myers — [Shrinking Women](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQucWXWXp3k)

### R

- Rachel Rostad — [To JK Rowling, from Cho Chang][JKRowling]
- Rachel Rostad — [Response To Critiques of "To JK Rowling, From Cho Chang"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04qQ1eNGJwM)

Guante is my man crush (though I like his music a lot better than his spoken word):

- Guante — [Ten Responses to the Phrase 'Man Up'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFoBaTkPgco)
- Guante — [REACH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJSa3_55H_k)

More Sam Cook:

- Sam Cook — [Flatland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6lKZAu25q8)

More Dylan Garity:

- Dylan Garity — [Rigged Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo3KFUzyMUI)

This is really good to watch around Thanksgiving and other such bullshit:

- Jovan Mays — [Play Ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mN4ycPgdc)

Kait Rokowski is pretty cool:

- Kait Rokowski — [New Insults](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro2lOEv7I6g)
- Kait Rokowski — [How To Cure a Feminist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW4VvIhhCIM)
- Kait Rokowski — [Christina Turner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16lextIaPkw)

This is really good:

- Pages Matam — [Piñata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgQRkHcEyq8)

And the coup de grace of all spoken word poetry, Staceyann Chin. You should just search her on youtube and watch all of the videos that come up. Though, in particular, watch these three:

- Staceyann Chin — [My First Period](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGk3-OJX7KE) — This is actually two poems in one video, but it’s well worth the 15 minute watch, especially the second poem, which is what the video is named after.
- Staceyann Chin — [All Oppression is Connected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkkhWg3gBno) — This is also two poems in one video, and it’s also well worth the 10 minute watch, especially the second poem, which is what the video is also named after.
- Staceyann Chin — [Tweet This, You Small-Minded Motherfucker!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vk13kf3en0)

[^1]: At some point in the future, I plan on also including an option to sort the pieces by topic. But that's a distant plan.
