My summary of this article was written as assigned article review for LIN 834, taken at Michigan State University with Alan Munn during the spring semester of 2013. As such, it is more in depth than any other review that has so far been posted on this blog, and it was written in LaTeX and is thus in [PDF format][CollinsArticleReview].[^1]

#### Notes

[^1]: It was later pointed out to me by Alan that what I have argued is a strength of Collins's analysis (section 2), is not actually necessarily a strength of the analysis&mdash;at least not straightforwardly&mdash;since there are arguably different Θ-roles involved in dative shifted constructions (_cf_. Pesetsky 1995). Compare:

    * {:.footnote-level-one-example}
        * {:.footnote-level-two-example} John sent the gift to Mary
        * {:.footnote-level-two-example} John sent Mary the gift
    * {:.footnote-level-one-example}
        * {:.footnote-level-two-example} John sent the gift to New York
        * {:.footnote-level-two-example} */#John sent New York the gift

    Since writing this assignment, I have not given any more thought to this argument and these data. Perhaps there is an independent explanation for the data in (i) and (ii). Perhaps not. To the extent that Θ-roles are syntactic, there might be an independent semantic/pragmatic explanation of (iib)&mdash;hence the hedge on ungrammaticality or anomaly. Such a line of reasoning would require a thorough investigation of the nature of Θ-roles, however, and I do not currently have the expertise (or the time) to pursue this line of reasoning. Thus, for now, I will only note that section 2 of this article review is perhaps a misled extension of Collins's (2005) analysis of the passive.
