#### Claim 

Fox & Grodzinsky argue against the claim in Borer & Wexler (1987) that the ability to form A-chains matures (1998:312). Moreover, they also claim that children's problems with nonactional passives result from the _by_-phrase (323).

#### Arguments 

To establish that the ability to form A-chains does not mature, Fox & Grodzinsky give three arguments. The first argument is that children can deal with A-chains. The second argument is that children cannot handle constructions that have relevant aspects of passives but no A-chains. Finally, the third argument is that empirical evidence suggests that it is actually the _by_-phrase that is responsible for children's problems with nonactional passives (312).

##### VP-Internal Subject Hypothesis & _Get_-Passives

The first argument against the maturation of the ability to form A-chains has two parts, and the first part arises in light of the VP-Internal Subject Hypothesis (Kitagawa 1986; Kuroda 1988; and Koopman & Sportiche 1991). Specifically, the VP-Internal Subject Hypothesis entails that every sentence (with a subject) has A-movement. Nonetheless, Borer & Wexler suggest that the A-chain Maturation Hypothesis from their 1987 can be weakened (1992:165, n. 13). Fox & Grodzinsky note that this proposal is very vague; as such, they offer a charitable proposal that they term the "Relaxed Maturation Hypothesis". They suggest that a Relaxed Maturation Hypothesis might hold that children are unable to handle A-chains that relate two potential Θ-positions, which neatly rules out A-chains formed by the movement relevant to the VP-Internal Subject Hypothesis but leaves A-chains formed by the NP-movement in passives subject to maturation (1998:313). Thus, the first part of the first argument is a weakening of the proposal in Borer & Wexler (1987).

The second part of the first argument involves _get_-passives. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that 3- and 4-year-old children produce full _get_-passives with a _by_-phrase (Crain, Thornton, & Murasugi 1987; Crain & Fodor 1989; and Crain 1991).<sup>1</sup> Moreover, Fox & Grodzinsky (1998) argue, following Haegeman (1985), that _get_-passives involve cyclic NP-movement, such as in (1):<sup>2</sup>


<p style="margin-left:3em">(1) John got [t pushed by Mary]</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(1998:314)</p>


As such, it follows that _get_-passives involve A-chains with two potential Θ-positions. If this is the correct syntax for _get_-passives, then even the Relaxed Maturation Hypothesis is false.

_Spanish Passives_

The second argument involves results from the experiment in Pierce (1992). Pierce (1992) demonstrates that children have trouble with both pre- and post-verbal passives in Spanish (as in (2)), and the latter probably do not involve A-chains:


<p style="margin-left:3em">(2)</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">a. Maria fue peinada por Juan.</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary was combed by  John</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">b. Fue peinada Maria por Juan.</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was combed Mary by  John</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(Fox & Grodzinsky 1998:316)</p>


Such data, of course, suggests that the problem that children have with passives is not related to A-chains, further discrediting the proposal of Borer & Wexler (1987; 1992) about the maturation of the ability to form A-chains.

##### The _By_-Phrase

Their third and final argument involves experimental data of their own, first reported in Fox, Grodzinsky, & Crain (1995). The experiment demonstrates that children's comprehension of nonactional passives without _by_-phrases, what they call truncated passives (as in (3)), is well above chance, though their performance on nonactional nontruncated passives (as in (4)) is below chance (1998:319).

<p style="margin-left:3em">(3) The bear is seen.</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(4) The boy is seen by the horse.</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(Fox & Grodzinsky 1998:317)</p>

This suggests that (i) children's problem with passives is unrelated to A-chains and that (ii) the problem is instead related to the _by_-phrase in passives (317-322).

#### Positive Account

In addition to their three arguments against the A-chain (Relaxed) Maturation Hypothesis of Borer & Wexler (1987; 1992), Fox & Grodzinsky also provide a brief positive account, arguing that the difference between child- and adult-comprehension of the passive turns on Θ-transmission (1998:323-330). This account turns on several features of _be_-passives, _get_-passives, their external arguments (or lack thereof), and properties of _by_-phrases in general.<sup>3</sup>

In brief, they argue that _by_-phrases can always assign some sort of affector/Agent semantics/Θ-role; however, in order for any other semantics, Θ-transmission is required. This predicts that children would be able to handle actional passives (since, in these cases, the complement of the _by_-phrase is some sort of affector), truncated passives, and _get_-passives (since, as they argue, _get_-passives don't have implicit external arguments), but not nonactional nontruncated passives (since the semantics of the complement of the _by_-phrase turns on Θ-transmission in these cases). This positive account also has the ability of being able to explain the acquisition data in Demuth (1989) about Sesotho passives (Fox & Grodzinsky 1998:329).
