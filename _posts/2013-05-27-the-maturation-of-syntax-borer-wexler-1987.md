#### Claim 

Borer & Wexler argue for a Maturation Hypothesis, contra Pinker's (1984) Continuity Hypothesis. The Maturation Hypothesis holds that certain principles&mdash;in the sense of 'principles and parameters'&mdash;are not fully available at certain stages of development; instead, they mature (1987:124).

#### Arguments

This brief summary will prevent the two arguments of Borer & Wexler's (1987) paper that I take to be most important for supporting their Maturation Hypothesis. The first is a conceptual argument, and the second is an empirical argument.

##### The Conceptual Argument

In brief, this is an _a priori reductio_ of the Continuity Hypothesis, the linchpin of which is the "triggering problem" (128).

This argument begins by considering two arbitrary features of a grammar, call them A and B. Let construction A precede construction B in acquisition. Then, the question arises as to why construction A precedes construction B in acquisition. They note that explanations for such phenomena have tended to appeal to either an intrinsic or extrinsic ordering explanation;[^1] however, given assumptions about modularity of the grammar, these explanations become less tenable (125-127).

That is to say, given a principles and parameters framework and given the modularity assumption, one would have to look for (a) particular principle(s) that govern(s) the individual modules and explain(s) the acquisition facts, rather than theorizing an ordering relation among the modules to explain the acquisition facts (127). And, having to look for such (a) principle(s) leads one to the triggering problem (128). The triggering problem is that one would expect the grammar of a child to set the principle(s) in question to the correct parameter as soon as she encounters the relevant data, yet this expectation is not empirically borne out.

So, given the two assumptions of principles and parameters and modularity, adopting the Continuity Hypothesis would seem to force one into a problematic position, as there is no ready explanation for the triggering problem.[^2]

As such, Borer & Wexler conclude that there seems to be an _a priori_ reason for rejecting the Continuity Hypothesis and adopting the Maturation Hypothesis.[^3]

Thus, (a simplified version of) their conceptual argument is:


<p style="margin-left:3em">Assume: Continuity Hypothesis</p>

<p style="margin-left:3em">(P1) Maintaing the Continuity Hypothesis requires finding (a) specific principle(s) to explain acquisition facts</p>

<p style="margin-left:3em">(P2) Having to look for (a) specific principle(s) that explain(s) acquisition facts lead to the triggering problem</p>

<p style="margin-left:3em">(P3) The triggering problem cannot be explained, <em>i.e.</em>, the predictions of (P2) are not empirically borne out</p>

<p style="margin-left:3em">(P4) ¬Continuity Hypothesis</p>

(C) Maturation Hypothesis


##### The Empirical Argument

Though they aren't explicitly committed to this being one of the principles that undergoes maturation (166),[^4] Borer & Wexler provide extensive evidence suggesting that children are not initially capable of forming A-chains. This evidence turns on acquisition data about passives in both English and Hebrew. They argue that adjectival passives in these languages do not involve A-movement, whereas verbal passives do (141-146). Thus, if the ability to form an A-chain undergoes maturation in the grammar, then one would expect children to be good with adjectival passives and bad with verbal passives. This is exactly what seems to be the case (146-157).

Given that such theoretical assumptions seem to explain the data, the data _a fortiori_ support the Maturation Hypothesis.

#### Notes
	
[^1]: For an explanation of what exactly intrinsic and extrinsic ordering explanations mean, see pp. 125-126.

	
[^2]: However, see Yang (2002) for an explanation of the triggering problem using the principles and parameters framework. If Yang is correct, then this conceptual argument, at least as it is reconstructed here, is unsound&mdash;specifically, (P3) is false.

	
[^3]: Of course, this conceptual argument doesn't 'disprove' the Continuity Hypothesis. It just establishes that it is _a priori_ unlikely; it might still be supported by empirical data, though Borer & Wexler argue that the empirical data also favors the Maturation Hypothesis, not the Continuity Hypothesis. Nonetheless, they do seem to put a lot of stock in the conceptual argument for the Maturation Hypothesis (_cf._ note 4).

	
[^4]: Indeed, they write that "[e]ven if maturation plays a key role in language acquisition, it may turn out, under deeper analysis, and considering a wider array of phenomena, that the particular Maturation Hypothesis has to be reformulated. It would be surprising if this were not the case" (166). That is to say, they seem to put more stock in the conceptual argument for the Maturation Hypothesis, rather than in purportedly having identified an instance of one such principle that undergoes maturation.
