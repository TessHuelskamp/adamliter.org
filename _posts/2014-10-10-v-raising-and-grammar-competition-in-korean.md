#### Their claim

Han et al. (2007) argue that some Korean speakers have grammars with V to T raising, whereas some do not.

They present experimental evidence that with the short form of negation in Korean---argued to be a clitic to the verb---and a quantified object DP of a transitive verb, some speakers allow a neg>&#8704; scope reading, whereas others only allow the surface scope reading of &#8704;>neg.

Korean is a head-final, SOV language, so there is hardly any evidence for or against V to T raising in the input for the child. Han et al. (2007) explain their findings by assuming that some speakers just choose a grammar with V to T raising and others do not.

#### Commentary

In their experiment, they find that the speakers who allow the neg>&#8704; scope reading also categorically allow the inverse scope reading. If speakers really only have one grammar (which, admittedly, is not necessarily the case) these facts might be unexpected. Nontheless, as they point out (pp. 32-33, fn. 19) the former scope reading entails the latter.

Thus, it might be interesting to replicate this study using a quantified DP that does not lead to an entailment relation between the differing scope readings. One possibility is in (1).

Of course, the neg>two scope reading is compatible with the two>neg scope reading, but there is at least no entailment relationship between the two readings.
