#### Claim

There are two majors claims in Hyams et al.&mdash;namely, (i) that the voicing phenomena in Malagasy is constituted by A'-movement and the trigger is a clause-external topic; and (ii) that Malagasy exhibits a parallel to the Root Infinitive (RI) stage (2006:1050).[^1] Moreover, a revision of the A-Chain Deficit Hypothesis of Borer & Wexler (1987) is proposed and supported.[^2]

#### Arguments

First, Hyams et al. provide a brief overview of the voicing phenomenon in Malagasy, distinguishing between AT voice, TT voice, and CT voice. (1a), (1b), and (1c) are examples of each of these, respectively, where, following Pearson (2005), triggers are boldfaced and actors are underlined.[^3]

In brief, different morphology shows up on the verb depending on the type of argument&mdash;the "trigger"&mdash;that is promoted to the clause-final position (1052-1055).

Next, Hyams et al. provide a brief review of two different theories of the Malagasy voicing system, one which analyzes the trigger as a subject&mdash;and thus, crucially, involves A-movement (1055-1057)&mdash;and another which analyzes the trigger as a topic&mdash;and thus, crucially, involves A'-movement (1057-1059). The former is largely attributed to Guilfoyle et al. (1992) and the latter to Pearson (2001, 2005).

The analyses are such that they make differing predictions about child language acquisition, given other acquisition work on A- and A'-movement in other languages. The differing predictions are the following:[^4]

<p style="margin-left:3em">(2)</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em"><u>The Subject Hypothesis</u></p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">SH1: AT voice is acquired before TT and CT voice</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">SH2: As a null subject language, Malagasy will not exhibit an RI stage, i.e. there will be no non-finite root clauses, and hence:</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">SH3: there will be no relationship between verb finiteness and trigger omission.</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em"><u>The Topic Hypothesis</u></p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">TH1: AT voice is acquired at the same time as TT voice (but possibly before CT voice).</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">TH2: Malagasy will exhibit an RI stage, i.e. there will be non-finite root clauses, and</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">TH3: the rate of trigger omission in non-finite clauses will exceed that of finite clauses</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(2006:1070)</p>

From here, then, Hyams et al. evaluate these differing predictions using taped recordings of three Malagasy-speaking children over the course of nine months, with ages ranging from as low as 1;6 in the beginning to as old as 2;8 at the end of the experiment (1071).[^5]

With regard to the first set of predictions, the evidence clearly favors the topic hypothesis (1074-1078). However, with regard to the second and third sets of predictions, the empirical evidence from their study is not so clearcut.

In terms of the second set of predictions, the three Malagasy children produced non-finite verbs in AT clauses 43% of the time and, in TT clauses, 29% of the time (CT clauses are considered independently). This, Hyams et al. note, is lower than would be expected, since the RI stage exhibited by children of this age in other languages tends to be between 40% and 50%; on the other hand, it is significantly greater than non-RI languages, whose children produce non-finite verbs in root clauses less than 10% of the time (1079).

Finally, in terms of the third set of predictions, the direction again favors the topic hypothesis, though it is not as significant as it is in those languages that do exhibit an RI stage. Specifically, finite verbs occur 54% of the time with overt triggers and non-finite verbs occur 60% of the time with null triggers (1079-1080). Compare this to averages of 23% and 70%, respectively, for RI languages (1069, Table 2).

Nonetheless, Hyams et al. argue that there is a confounding factor, preventing these frequencies from matching more closely to the frequencies found in RI languages (1080-1084). Moreover, the first set of predictions, evaluated against the empirical data from their study, clearly favors the topic hypothesis.[^6]

Finally, Hyams et al. consider an objection from frameworks such as those of connectionist models of language acquisition that argue for statistical learning accounts. They consider this objection because the frequencies of AT, TT, and CT clauses in child speech seem to track child-directed speech (1077, Table 9). The reply to such an objection is relatively standard; they respond both on theoretical and empirical grounds (1084-1086). Furthermore, they also field the follow-up objection that CT frequency in child speech very closely matches the frequency in child-directed speech but diverges significantly from adult speech (1077, Table 9). Following Pearson (2001, 2005), they respond by attributing this to the syntactic and morphological complexity of such constructions (1087).

#### Notes
	
[^1]: For a succinct overview of what is exactly entailed by RIs, see this [handout](http://ling-blogs.bu.edu/lx500a1s10/files/2010/01/lx500acqs10-02b-nrfs-handout.pdf) from Paul Hagstrom.

[^2]: This point will not be discussed in this blog post. See pp. 1062-1064 for the details. Hyams et al. advance what they call the "Canonical alignment hypothesis" (1064).

[^3]: Note that the differing translations of (1b) and (1c) are meant to pay respect to the fact that there are two competing analyses. Ultimately, of course, Hyams et al. end up arguing for the trigger as topic (or A'-movement) analysis of Malagasy voicing.

[^4]: See pp. 1060-1070 for the details of how exactly these predictions arise from the two competing theories of Malagasy voicing. In brief, the fact that the subject analysis involves A-movement means it is analogous to null subject languages (since the trigger can be dropped in Malagasy), whereas the fact that the topic analysis involves A'-movement means it is analogous to V2 languages, which tend to be RI languages.

[^5]: It is probably worth nothing that n=3 is pretty small.

[^6]: It is worth noting that all of the arguments in this paper rely on certain theoretical assumptions about the nature of the Language Acquisition Device and language acquisition in general. See pp. 1051-1052 for a delineation of these assumptions. They are not uncontroversial assumptions; however, I think I largely agree with the assumptions.
