# /about

I'm a first year PhD student in
the [Department of Linguistics][umd-ling]
at [University of Maryland][umd]. My advisors are [Jeff Lidz][jeff]
and [Norbert Hornstein][norbert].  For more information about my
research, see my [research page][research].

Outside of linguistics, I'm also interested in web development,
programming, and system administration.  And I **really** like coffee.
I worked as a barista, off-and-on, for a few years at the Dunn Bros at
the Smith Douglas More House, now known as [Rustica][DB].
