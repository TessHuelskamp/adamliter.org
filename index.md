# /about

I'm a trained linguist with interests in web development, programming, and system administration.
For more information about my research, see my [research page][research].

I **really** like coffee.
I worked as a barista, off-and-on, for a few years at the Dunn Bros at the Smith Douglas More House, now known as [Rustica][DB].
