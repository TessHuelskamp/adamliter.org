## About Me
					
### In a <del>nutshell</del> bulleted list of no particular order:

- Language
- Philosophy
- Social justice organizing
- Coffee

### And now in some brief, expository paragraphs:
			
I grew up in occupied Dakota territory, or just outside of Minneapolis, Minnesota. For the last four years, I have been living in occupied Anishinaabek territory, attending Michigan State University.[^1]

I have a B.A. in linguistics and a B.A. in philosophy from Michigan State; I'm currently pursuing an M.A. in linguistics, also at Michigan State. For more about my academic work, see my [academic page][academic].
					
My senior year of high school was when I began organizing, though my experiences and the relationships that I made in my undergraduate years were most formative for my views on politics, social justice, organizing, and anti-oppressive praxis. (Though these views are still growing and evolving and will hopefully always be growing and evolving.)

Currently, I'm working with a nascent collective called the [Dis-Orientation Collective][DOC]. Check it out, and get involved if you're interested!
					
I **really** like coffee. I worked as a barista, off-and-on, for a few years at the [Dunn Bros at the Smith Douglas More House][DB].

#### Notes

[^1]: If you're wondering why I'm recognizing the Indigienous peoples who were here before, it is because I think such an act is an important first step in pushing back against colonialism and highlighting the fact that there is an ongoing genocide against Indigineous peoples. A friend of mine has written [a piece][tyler] that goes into more detail about the importance of this.
