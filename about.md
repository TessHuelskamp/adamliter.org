## About Me
					
In a <del>nutshell</del> bulleted list of no particular order:

- Language
- Philosophy
- Activism
- Coffee
- Em dashes
					
I'm currently a student at Michigan State University, studying linguistics and philosophy. For more about that, see my [academic page](http://academic.adamliter.org).
					
Through a good bit of na&#239;vet&#233; concerned with wanting to make a difference, I've cultivated an identity as a hardened (read: cynical) activist, though an activist nonetheless. My views about politics and activism have been heavily influenced by many, though I think two people in particular are worth mentioning: Tabitha Skervin (a friend) &amp; [Guante](http://guante.info).
					
I **really** like coffee. I worked as a barista, off-and-on, for a few years at the [Dunn Bros at the Smith Douglas More House](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dunn-Bros-at-the-Smith-Douglas-More-House/133169107463?fref=ts).
					
And I also really fucking like em dashes&#8212;I probably use them too much in my writing&#8212;, I think, because they're the best tool for approximating how I tend to speak:
					
<blockquote>
The em dash, m dash, m-rule, or "mutton" (&#8212;) often demarcates a break of thought or some similar interpolation stronger than the interpolation demarcated by parentheses &#8211; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#Em_dash">Wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>
					
As a result, I tend to have a lot of typographical splotches in my writing that look like '&#8212;,'. I actually think this looks kinda cool. Sorry grammatical and typographical purists.
