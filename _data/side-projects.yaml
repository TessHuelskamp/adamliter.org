  description: What began as part of an impromptu LaTeX workshop at the 2015 Linguistic Institute has turned into a <a href="https://bit.ly/latex-workshop">full-fledged handout</a> intended to familiarize folks with the typesetting system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>. The handout is intended to be useful to anyone just starting with LaTeX, though one section does address some things that might be useful to linguists in particular. I really welcome and appreciate feedback about the handout so that I can continue to improve it. Please send any feedback you might have to me via <a href="mailto:tex@adamliter.org?subject=LaTeX workshop handout feedback">email</a> or raise it as a <a href="https://github.com/adamliter/latex-workshop/issues">GitHub issue</a>.
