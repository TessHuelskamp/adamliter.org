Here's a [link to documentation](http://adamliter.org/content/LaTeX/macros/SemMacros/SemanticsMacros.pdf) for LaTeX macros that I&mdash;with the help of Alan Munn's [answer on TeX.SX](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/121605/macro-for-typesetting-semantic-denotations-linguistics)&mdash;have written in order to make the typesetting of semantic denotations and computations both easier and more readable.<sup>1</sup> Suggestions and improvements are more than welcome.

#### Notes

  1. I have provided a link to a PDF rather than writing the macros themselves directly into this blog post, as I suspect the macros will evolve over time; this way, then, I can simply update the PDF, and this blog post will always contain the most recent macros that I have written for typesetting semantics.
