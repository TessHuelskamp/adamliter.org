In chapter 15 of _Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature_, entitled _The Faux Dévot_, Erich Auerbach traces the mixing of two initially disjoint literary styles—namely, a higher style (associated with the genre of tragedy and the sublime) and a lower style (associated with the genre of comedy, the empiricism of everyday experience, and the distinctly human, or “creatural," component thereof)—to their resurgent separation as manifest in the French classicism of the 17th century.


> In the tragedies of French classicism as will be self-evident after all that has been said, the strictest seclusion of the tragic personages and the tragic action from everything below them prevails. Even the prince’s immediate entourage is drawn upon only for a few figures indispensable to the action, or confidants; everyone else is _on_. The people are referred to but rarely and only in the most general terms. (382)


Let me be up front. I intend to focus on the interpretation of the sentence, "everyone else is _on_," and its bearing on the chapter as a whole. I was not able to find the original German text of this passage, which is unfortunate since there are a variety of translations in German for the English preposition "on" that would help greatly to elucidate the intended meaning of the sentence. Nonetheless, I think there are two distinct lines of interpretation for this sentence that are each—in their own rights—worth examining.

First, while not the most intuitive reading due to the particularities of English grammar, the reading that seems most logical is one in which "is" is understood as an auxiliary verb and the main verb ("drawn") has been elided. In other words, there is a reading in which this sentence is syntactically parallel to the one preceding it, meaning that the prince’s entourage is drawn upon and that everyone else is "drawn" on. While it is debatable as to whether there is a significant difference between on and upon in this usage—indeed, according to [Merriam-Webster (online)](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/draw), both are acceptable usages of the idiomatic expression—it seems, nevertheless, that the fact of the difference in translation indicates a difference in meaning. This difference in meaning intuitively fits the resurgent separation of low and high styles—and also of lower and upper classes (both with respect to each other and both vis-à-vis the ruling class)—that Auerbach argues are particular to this epoch. The lower class is only of import insofar as it contributes to the (material) sustentation of the (life)style of both the upper and ruling class, and those of the bourgeoisie/upper class are of import insofar as they contribute to the maintenance of the social order (and thus the (ideological) sustenance of the (life)style of the ruling class).

However, there also seems to be a second more intuitive reading—more intuitive insofar as the particularities of the English grammar make it so—that, I think, proves to be more interesting, especially with regard to ascertaining the reality that colored Auerbach’s interpretations of these French classicist texts. The second reading I would like to examine is one in which "is" is the copula verb of English and "on" is the (often locative) preposition. Normally, one would expect to find an accompanying prepositional object indicative of the location of the subject, in this case, "everyone else." However, such a noun has been elided. Intuitive speculation as to what this nominal omission could be leads one to nominal phrases such as "the periphery." However, such an initial speculation produces no more significant a meaning than the previous reading in which this sentence was read as syntactically parallel to the prior sentence. Stretching this reading—admittedly perhaps a bit further than it should be stretched, justifiable although, I think, by the results it produces—one can imagine such a reading in which "everyone else" is "on" "the upper and ruling classes." This then can be read as a preposition that expresses a state of, in this case, dependency.

Now, it does seem reasonable to say that the lower classes were in a state of dependency—dependency on the upper and ruling classes—(minimally) with respect to aesthetic and literary production. Moreover, it is reasonable, as Auerbach goes on to delineate, the pressure—if one takes "on" to be locative and literal, this produces an interesting mental image of what this pressure could look like—that this placed upon the upper and ruling classes, pressure which ultimately amounted to the incorporation of a lower class aesthetic into that of the upper and ruling classes (cf. chapter 19, _Germinie Lacerteux_).

Other than simply indicating the eventual (re)mixing of the two styles, this reading, however, also indicates (and foreshadows) Auerbach’s words in chapter 20, _The Brown Stocking_: "Beneath the conflicts, and also through them, an economic and cultural leveling process is taking place. It is still a long way to a common life of mankind on earth, but the goal begins to be visible. And it is most concretely visible now in the unprejudiced precise, interior and exterior representation of the random moment in the lives of different people" (552). In other words, this pressure-ridden process that the use of the preposition "on" evokes is also indicative of the Hegelian influence running throughout Auerbach’s work—specifically, in this instance, that of the (process of the) Hegelian dialectic.

This economic and cultural leveling thus seems to be an ideal (or complete) version of the dialectical process in which thesis and antithesis have been synthesized (contrast this with the incomplete synthesizing of the two styles that Auerbach describes in chapter 3, _The Arrest of Peter Valvomeres_). Finally, and what is surely closer to home for Auerbach, such a reading of the preposition "on" points to what must have been an incomprehensible yearning for such a leveling—namely, the fact of being a German Jew in the (post-)Nazi era.

Ultimately then, what I think justifies this perhaps 'stretched' reading is the surely correct conclusion that Auerbach must be desirous of (the Hegelian synthesis of) an equitable and interdependent society as contrasted with a society in which categorical dependencies (e.g. one class/race/gender being dependent on another) create the distinct possibility of terrible human conflict, suffering, and subjugation. In light of this, it seems one could advance the claim—a claim that this _explication de texte_ does not necessarily purport to defend (for it would require much more than this single analysis) but nonetheless supports—that Auerbach’s _Mimesis_ attempted to facilitate or direct the literary (and aesthetic) leveling aspect of this "economic and cultural leveling process."
