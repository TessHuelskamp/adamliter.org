#### Rationale

When it comes down to it, I'm really not a programmer or a computer scientist. I just dabble in various things because I find it interesting, and I also find that there are some great ways to increase productivity with certain tools.[^1] In particular, I'm interested in learning Emacs because of [`org-mode`][orgmode]. This [article][workflow] by [Kieran Healy][kieran] makes, I think, a good case for learning Emacs (and `org-mode`) if you work in the social sciences (and I think this applies for the hard sciences, like linguistics, too).

#### Resources

So anyway, I'm going to try to learn Emacs. Who knows if I will succeed. Perhaps not. But I wanted to start out doing things right, and I came across this series of three blog posts ([1][partone], [2][parttwo], [3][partthree]) by [Yusuke Tsutsumi][yusuke], which, I think, are really helpful for trying to start learning Emacs the right way, where 'right way' here means maintaing a `~/.emacs.d/` directory that can be cloned on any machine and reproduce the same environment.
